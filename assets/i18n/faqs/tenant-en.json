    "Question": "Can I be locked out of my home during the COVID-19 emergency?",
    "Answer": "<p><strong>No.</strong> Two different government orders prevent lockouts at this time.</p><ol><li><p><strong>The State Order</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>On March 19, 2020, New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a>, which immediately suspends evictions throughout the state. This is called an “eviction moratorium,” and it means that, except in rare circumstances, <strong>no tenant may be removed from his or her home as a result of an eviction proceeding</strong>. The state eviction moratorium will last until two months after Governor Murphy declares an end to the COVID-19 health crisis. The Governor has extended the official public health emergency several times, most recently through <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-200.pdf'>Executive Order 200</a>, which will expire on December 22nd. Unless the Governor extends the emergency again, or ends it early, the eviction moratorium will last at least until <strong>February 22, 2021</strong>.</p><p>The state eviction moratorium does <strong>not</strong> affect what rent is due. <strong>Tenants still owe the rent</strong>. The moratorium also does not stop court proceedings; instead, it prevents lockouts and removals. The New Jersey Supreme Court controls court proceedings related to eviction. More information is below.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Federal Order</strong></p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>On September 1, 2020, the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued an <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19654.pdf'>order</a> that prevents residential lockouts for some residential tenants through December 31, 2020. The CDC recently issued <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/eviction-moratoria-order-faqs.pdf'>FAQs</a> interpreting the order. New Jersey tenants can ignore the CDC order for now because the state eviction moratorium, which is more protective than the CDC order, controls.",

    "Question": "What if I live in a hotel/motel? Can I be evicted while the State Order is in place?",
    "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> The state order <span>permits a hotel or motel to evict </span>a “transient guest or seasonal tenant.” Longtime hotel and motel residents, along with many others, are not considered “transient” or “seasonal,” however, and therefore remain protected from eviction under the Order. In general, residents cannot be evicted if they “have no permanent housing to which they may safely or lawfully return and live at a hotel or motel on a continual basis.” Under Administrative Orders <a href='https://d31hzlhk6di2h5.cloudfront.net/20200404/76/54/49/6d/782ba5a402ce762190ffdf92/AO_2020-8.pdf'>2020-08</a> and <a href='http://d31hzlhk6di2h5.cloudfront.net/20200424/b7/cb/1b/ce/b43a111240a42d0194ce7531/AO_2020-9.PDF'>2020-09</a> (issued by the State Director of Emergency Management on April 4 and April 24, 2020), the following hotel and motel residents are generally protected from eviction:</p><ul><li>those who are part of state initiatives aimed at getting people out of group shelters;</li><li>those supported by a governmental housing assistance program;</li><li>health-care workers who need a temporary place to stay;</li><li>homeless people;</li><li>individuals affected by domestic violence; and</li><li>those staying in hotels or motels in compliance with a court order.</li><ul><p>Others may be protected as well.

    "Question": "What if my landlord locks me out illegally?",
    "Answer": "<p>It is a crime for your landlord to lock you out. Under New Jersey law, only the courts can order evictions, and only government officials can remove you from your home. If your landlord locks you out, call the local police. They are required to help you get back into your home. If they tell you this is a “civil” matter that doesn’t involve them, ask them to look at this statute: N.J.S.A. 2C: 33-11.1.</p> ",

The landlord must comply with such a request. If the tenant causes damage to the apartment (beyond ordinary wear and tear), the landlord may require the tenant to pay for that damage if and when the landlord would otherwise have been entitled to recoup the cost from the security deposit. If the lease is renewed, the landlord may also require the tenant to post a new security deposit either six months after the end of the Public Health Emergency or when the lease is renewed, whichever is later.</p> ",

    "Question": "Does federal law prevent my landlord from filing an eviction case against me?",
    "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> The federal <a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr748/text'>CARES Act</a> prohibited covered landlords (see below) from filing an eviction complaint for nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25, 2020. If a landlord covered by the CARES Act filed such an eviction complaint during this period, the tenant can request that the case be dismissed. A dismissal will not stop the landlord from filing a new complaint, but the landlord must first give the tenant 30 days’ notice (see below).</p><p>Landlords covered by the CARES Act include:</p><ul><li>Those who hold a federally backed mortgage, such as a mortgage from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Housing Administration.</li><li>Those who rent to federally subsidized tenants, including tenants who:<ul><li>live in public housing,</li><li>have a Section 8 Housing Choice voucher,</li><li>live in Section 8 project-based housing, or</li><li>live in other types of federally funded housing, including, among others, certain housing programs for seniors, people with disabilities, people with HIV/AIDS, and people at risk of homelessness.</li></ul></li><li>The National Low Income Housing Coalition has constructed a <a href='https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums'>searchable database</a> of many (but not all) of the properties covered by the CARES Act.</li></ul><p>After July 25, covered landlords who <span>want to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent must first serve the tenant with a notice giving the tenant 30 days to vacate. The CARES Act states that a landlord</span> may not “require the tenant to vacate” the property until 30 days after giving the tenant a notice to vacate. In New Jersey, a landlord may not require a tenant to leave his or her home except through a court proceeding. Under the CARES Act, therefore, a covered landlord must give New Jersey tenants 30 days’ notice before such a court proceeding. In any case, a lockout cannot happen until the moratorium under the <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>state order</a> is lifted.</p><p>As noted above, the CARES Act ban on eviction filings by covered landlords expired on July 25. Tenants should know, however, that the CARES Act also prohibited covered landlords from charging fees (such as late fees or attorney’s fees) related to nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. Tenants in covered properties do not owe such fees.</p><p>The CARES Act gives tenants additional protection if they live in a building with five or more units and the owner got permission to delay payments on a federally backed mortgage loan. In that case, the owner may not file an eviction action for nonpayment of rent, or charge late fees related to nonpayment of rent, during the period when the owner is allowed to delay making mortgage payments. When this period ends, the owner must give tenants 30 days’ notice before taking the tenant to court to get an order requiring the tenant to vacate the property (but the lockout cannot happen in any case until the moratorium under the <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>state order</a> is lifted).</p><p>The state Supreme Court has required landlords to <a href='https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200724a.pdf?c=DfF'>certify their compliance with the CARES Act</a>, and the Administrative Office of the Courts issued a form certification as Attachment 6 to its <a href='https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200728c.pdf?c=FLj'>July 28 directive.</a></p>",
