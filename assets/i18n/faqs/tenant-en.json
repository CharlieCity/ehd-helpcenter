    "Question": "Can I be locked out of my home during the COVID-19 emergency?",
    "Answer": "<p><strong>No.</strong> Two different government orders prevent lockouts at this time.</p><ol><li><strong>The State Order</strong></li></ol><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>On March 19, 2020, New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a>, which immediately suspends evictions throughout the state. This is called an “eviction moratorium,” and it means that, except in rare circumstances, <strong>no tenant may be removed from his or her home as a result of an eviction proceeding</strong>. The state eviction moratorium will last until two months after Governor Murphy declares an end to the COVID-19 health crisis. The Governor has extended the official public health emergency several times, most recently through <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-180.pdf'>Executive Order 180</a>, which will expire on September 26. Unless the Governor extends the emergency again, or ends it early, the eviction moratorium will last at least until <strong>November 26</strong>.</p><ol start='2'><li><strong>The Federal Order</strong></li></ol><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>On September 1, 2020, the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued an <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19654.pdf'>order</a> that prevents lockouts through <strong>December 31</strong>, but only for some residential tenants. The federal order prevents only evictions for nonpayment of rent and associated fees. Because the state order prevents nearly all lockouts, it is broader in this respect than the federal order. The federal order explicitly provides that state orders control insofar as they protect the public health more broadly than the federal order by suspending more evictions. Therefore, so long as the state order is in effect, it controls. But if the state order expires before year-end, the federal order will then control, and its protections are narrower.</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'>To get the benefit of the federal order, <strong>each adult listed on the lease or rental agreement must complete and provide a declaration (i.e., sworn statement) to the landlord</strong>. The form declaration is included at the end of the order posted <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19654.pdf'>here</a>. Among other things, tenants must swear that they:</p><ul><li style='padding-left: 30px;'>have tried their best to get available government assistance;</li><li style='padding-left: 30px;'>expect to have no more than $99,000 in income in 2020 (or twice that if filing joint tax returns), or did not have to report any income in 2019, or received an Economic Impact Payment (i.e., a stimulus check) under the federal CARES Act;</li><li style='padding-left: 30px;'>cannot pay their full rent because of substantial loss of household income, loss of paid work hours, lay-offs, or extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses;</li><li style='padding-left: 30px;'>are trying their best to pay what rent they can; and</li><li style='padding-left: 30px;'>would probably be homeless, or have to live in too-close quarters, if they were evicted.</li></ul><p>The state and federal eviction moratoria do <strong>not</strong> affect what rent is due. <strong>Tenants still owe the rent.</strong> The moratoria also do not stop court proceedings; instead, they prevent lockouts and removals. The New Jersey Supreme Court controls court proceedings related to eviction, which are suspended for now. More information is below.</p>",

    "Answer": "<p>It is a crime for your landlord to lock you out. Under New Jersey law, only the courts can order evictions, and only government officials can remove you from your home. If your landlord locks you out, call the local police. They are required to help you get back into your home.

    "Answer": "<p><strong>Yes.</strong> On April 24, Governor Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-128.pdf'>Executive Order 128</a>, which allows tenants to request in writing (including by email or text) that their landlords apply their security deposits to the rent they owe during the Public Health Emergency and for up to 60 days afterwards. The landlord must comply with such a request. If the tenant causes damage to the apartment (beyond ordinary wear and tear), the landlord may require the tenant to pay for that damage if and when the landlord would otherwise have been entitled to recoup the cost from the security deposit. If the lease is renewed, the landlord may also require the tenant to post a new security deposit either six months after the end of the Public Health Emergency or when the lease is renewed, whichever is later.</p> ",

    "Question": "Does federal law prevent my landlord from filing an eviction case against me?",
    "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> The federal <a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr748/text'>CARES Act</a> prohibited covered landlords (see below) from filing an eviction complaint for nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. If a landlord covered by the CARES Act filed such an eviction complaint during this period, the tenant can request that the case be dismissed. A dismissal will not stop the landlord from filing a new complaint, but the landlord must first give the tenant 30 days’ notice (see below).</p><p>Landlords covered by the CARES Act include:</p><ul><li>Those who hold a federally backed mortgage, such as a mortgage from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Housing Administration.</li><li>Those who rent to federally subsidized tenants, including tenants who:<ul><li>live in public housing,</li><li>have a Section 8 Housing Choice voucher,</li><li>live in Section 8 project-based housing, or</li><li>live in other types of federally funded housing, including, among others, certain housing programs for seniors, people with disabilities, people with HIV/AIDS, and people at risk of homelessness.</li></ul></li><li>The National Low-Income Housing Coalition has constructed a <a href='https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums'>searchable database</a> of many (but not all) of the properties covered by the CARES Act.</li></ul><p>After July 25, covered landlords who <span>want to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent must first serve the tenant with a notice giving the tenant 30 days to vacate. The CARES Act states that a landlord</span> may not “require the tenant to vacate” the property until 30 days after giving the tenant a notice to vacate. In New Jersey, a landlord may not require a tenant to leave his or her home except through a court proceeding. Under the CARES Act, therefore, a covered landlord must give New Jersey tenants 30 days’ notice before such a court proceeding. In any case, a lockout cannot happen until the moratorium under the <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>state order</a> is lifted.</p><p>As noted above, the CARES Act ban on eviction filings by covered landlords expired on July 25. Tenants should know, however, that the CARES Act also prohibited covered landlords from charging fees (such as late fees or attorney’s fees) related to nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. Tenants in covered properties do not owe such fees.</p><p>The CARES Act gives tenants additional protection if they live in a building with five or more units and the owner got permission to delay payments on a federally backed mortgage loan. In that case, the owner may not file an eviction action for nonpayment of rent, or charge late fees related to nonpayment of rent, during the period when the owner is allowed to delay making mortgage payments. When this period ends, the owner must give tenants 30 days’ notice before taking the tenant to court to get an order requiring the tenant to vacate the property (but the lockout cannot happen in any case until the moratorium under the <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>state order</a> is lifted).</p><p>The state Supreme Court has required landlords to <a href='https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200724a.pdf?c=DfF'>certify their compliance with the CARES Act</a>, and the Administrative Office of the Courts issued a form certification as Attachment 6 to its July 28 directive.</p> ",
