Applications were scored to prioritize personal services (barber shops, hair salons, nail salons), businesses that employ Newark residents, MWBE businesses and those that did not receive funding in the earlier round of City grants. The program was available city wide with a major share of the funds reserved for the hardest hit zip codes (07104, 07105 and 07107). Only businesses that complied with the ten-day shutdown from November 25th to December 4th were eligible.</p><blockquote>&quot;With limited funds, we are working to help Newark businesses, tenants, artists and others facing financial ruin from COVID-19 to survive and recover,&quot; said Mayor Baraka. &quot;The Small Business Emergency Fund is one of the many ways that we are pulling together as a community to fight the virus and restore our economy. In collaboration with President Biden, our federal, state and city legislators and our philanthropic community, we are working to expand the help that we can provide to Newark’s small businesses.&quot;</blockquote><p>Allison Ladd, Deputy Mayor and Director of Economic and Housing Development said that 110 businesses received grants. 62% of them went to businesses in the hardest hit zip codes. 31% of the awards went to food/beverage businesses, 25% to salon/barber/ personal services businesses, 14% to retail businesses and the remainder to a variety of other categories.</p>"

The survey is available to all Newark small businesses and can be accessed <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/newarksmallbiz'>here</a>.</p><p>“We need to hear directly from small businesses about how the City can best support them. COVID-19 has presented small businesses with unprecedented challenges, and now it's important to look ahead to the future,” Mayor Baraka said. “By creating emergency funds to help our small businesses survive over the last year, we have worked to keep Newark strong. Businesses are resilient and ready to bounce back. This survey will enable us to find the best ways to help them recover, grow stronger and prosper.”</p><p>“No ward is identical, but one thing’s for sure: our neighborhoods are struggling. We are grateful to have a good partner in the City, and we commend the Mayor for taking the opportunity to take a data-driven approach,” said Anthony McMillian, CEO of Newark Downtown District. “I call on every small business in Newark to do their part and make their voices heard. In only 10 minutes, you can help shape how the City will allocate its resources to help your business and neighborhood thrive.”</p><p>The survey was developed in collaboration with Bloomberg Associates, a pro-bono consultancy which works with cities and mayors around the world. The survey’s results will help the City better determine how businesses and different industries across the city were impacted and what kinds of City actions will be most helpful for small businesses to recover and thrive. It will provide guidance in how to spend new federal dollars coming from President Biden’s recovery legislation.</p><p>The City will seek information on such topics as the most important COVID-19 challenges, changes in sales and income, and how the City could strengthen services and best help with recovery. All small Newark small business are encouraged to respond. The survey will be open starting today, May 12, until June 9th, and will be available in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.  It is being distributed online and by business and community organizations.</p><p>If you have any questions you may contact Jay Lee, Small Business Development Officer at <a href='mailto:smallbiz@ci.newark.nj.us'>smallbiz@ci.newark.nj.us</a>.</p>"
