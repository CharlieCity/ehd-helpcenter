        text: `<p>Those affected personally by COVID-19 or by its impact on a family member may be eligible for a range of benefits including federal emergency paid sick leave, federal emergency childcare FMLA, earned sick leave, workers' compensation; unemployment insurance, temporary disability or family leave insurance.</p>
        <p>To find out if you are eligible and to apply for state benefits, visit the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/labor/">New Jersey Department of Laborâ€™s website</a>. There you will also find a helpful chart clarifying the different scenarios and the available benefits in English and Spanish.</p>
        <p>Residents eligible for unemployment will receive an additional $600 per week through July 31 through additional Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.</p>
        <p>In addition, freelancers, gig workers, and independent contractors - who are typically not eligible for unemployment insurance -- are able to apply for the $600 Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. They should apply for unemployment now. This claim likely will be denied, but your ineligibility for regular unemployment is a prerequisite for receiving benefits due to COVID-19.</p>
        <p>In addition, Governor Murphy has signed a new law expanding the State's Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) and Family Leave Insurance (FLI) programs to provide more workers with access to paid leave benefits during public health emergencies.</p>`

          <p>The law allows individuals access to TDI and FLI benefits during a public health emergency if they must take time off of work because they are diagnosed with or suspected of exposure to a communicable disease or to take care of a family member diagnosed with or suspected of exposure to a communicable disease.
          <p>The bill also expands New Jersey's earned sick leave law to permit the use of earned sick time for isolation or quarantine recommended or ordered by a provider or public health official as a result of suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or to care for a family member under recommended or ordered isolation or quarantine.

If employers do so, they will be eligible for a dollar-for-dollar payroll tax credit against those costs -- this is available to 99.8 percent of all businesses in New Jersey, and all but our largest employers.</p>`
